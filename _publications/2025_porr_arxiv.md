The fact that redundant information does not change a rational belief after Bayesian updating implies uniqueness of Bayes rule. In fact, any updating rule is uniquely specified by this principle. This is true for the classical setting, as well as settings with improper or continuous priors. We prove this result and illustrate it with two examples.
